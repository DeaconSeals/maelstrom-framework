# Maelstrom Framework
Maelstrom is a Python library designed to facilitate rapid prototyping and exploration of weak-typed tree GP, strong-typed tree GP, island model, and coevolution with flexibility that enables support for accelerator frameworks such as JAX. The architecture and features of Maelstrom are discussed alongside several example applications employing Gym environments and an accelerated version of predator-prey.

## Installation
```
pip install maelstrom-evolution
```
It is also recommended to install the snake eyes parser to convenientently parse configuration files. See the examples for further demonstration on how to use the snake eyes parser.
```
pip install snake-eyes-parser
```

## Examples
Examples for this framework can be found in the following repo:
